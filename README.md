# FAQ Component Project

## Description

This project is an FAQ component built using HTML and CSS. Users can click on a question to toggle the visibility of the corresponding answer. The component is designed with a responsive layout for both mobile and desktop screens.

## Note!!

This project includes two versions of the FAQ accordion component:

- **`in.html`**: Uses input type `checkbox` to toggle the visibility of answers.
- **`index.html`**: Uses input type `radio` to toggle the visibility of answers, following an accordion behavior where only one answer is visible at a time.

Both files achieve the same functionality but operate differently based on the input type used.

## Features

- Toggle answers by clicking on questions.
- Accordion behavior: only one answer is visible at a time.
- Fully responsive design:
  - Stacks vertically on mobile.
  - Horizontal layout on larger screens.
